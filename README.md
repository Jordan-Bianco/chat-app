# Chat app

## Description
Chat application, built with Laravel, Vue, InertiaJs and Pusher, where a group of users can chat with each other, both in public chat and by exchanging private messages (as long as they belong to the same group).<br>
Once registered in the application, the user can create his own group.<br>
Once the group has been created, the leader can invite people to join, manage the roles of the various members and manage the requests received.
Each group has its own activity feed.
